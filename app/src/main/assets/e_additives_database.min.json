It can cause allergic reactions, hyperactivity or other reactions (twitching). Not recommended for children, as the group for supporting children's hyperactivity strongly advocates discontinuing the additive due to its impact on hyperactive behavioral disorders in children. In combination with high vitamin C content, free radicals can be produced that damage cells, including DNA.
