  "general_notes": "These are continuous cardio activities, so track by total duration rather than sets/reps. Calorie coefficients are averages based on MET values from the Compendium of Physical Activities (e.g., walking 3-4 mph ~3.5-5 METs, running 5-10 mph ~8-13 METs). Actual burn varies by terrain, fitness level, and exact pace. Use app timer for duration."
