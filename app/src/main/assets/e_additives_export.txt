E100 - curcumin Curcumin

Name: curcumin Curcumin
Description: Curcumin is an additive added to foods as a yellow-orange colorant. It is the active substance in the spice turmeric (Curcuma longa). A plant from the ginger family, originating from South Asia. It is cultivated in India, Indonesia, and China. There it is mostly used as a spice (ground root), and also as a dye for fabric, as it gives a yellow pigment.
Function: Additive added to foods as a yellow-orange colorant.
Origin: Plant from the ginger family, originating from South Asia. Cultivated in India, Indonesia, and China.
Health risks: In recommended doses, it is not problematic, but it is not recommended for people with gallstones, jaundice, colic, and liver poisoning. It is also not advisable to take it in larger quantities, as it can cause nausea and migraines. Exceptionally, it can pose a health risk (allergy or food sensitivity). In any case, it is necessary to consider that there is a big difference between curcumin obtained from the plant and that which is synthetically obtained.

E320 - butylated hydroxyanisole (Butylated hydroxyanisole)

Name: butylated hydroxyanisole (Butylated hydroxyanisole)
Description: Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) is an antioxidant obtained by the reaction of 4-methoxyphenol and isobutylene.
Function: It inhibits oxidation and the development of unpleasant odors, used as a preservative.
Origin: Not specified.
Health risks: The US National Institutes of Health report carcinogenicity in test animals, especially in large doses. The recommended daily dose up to 0.5 mg/kg body weight is considered much too low by some to cause cancer, but by others, e.g., the state of California, the substance is carcinogenic. It can cause allergic reactions, hyperactivity or other reactions (twitching). Not recommended for children, as the group for supporting children's hyperactivity strongly advocates discontinuing the additive due to its impact on hyperactive behavioral disorders in children. In combination with high vitamin C content, free radicals can be produced that damage cells, including DNA. This has prompted many discussions in the EU and in the ANS additives committee to initiate additional studies on harmfulness and limit the use of BHA.
Usage in foods: Added to edible oils, fats, margarines, chewing gums, candies, nuts, and generally foods with high fat content (e.g., in quick-prepare potato products and bakery products, because it is stable at high temperatures such as in biscuits, cakes, pastries).
Acceptable daily intake (ADI): Up to 0.5 mg/kg body weight
Other details: Used in food and its packaging, animal feed, cosmetics, rubber products, petroleum derivatives, and medicines. Added to edible oils, fats, margarines, chewing gums, candies, nuts, and high-fat foods since the mid-20th century. Banned in Japan since 1958.
